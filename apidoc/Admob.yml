    Allows for the display of AdMob in Titanium Android applications.

    Please note that if your androidManifest has screen support set to: android:anyDensity="false", any banner ads will 
    display too small on high density devices.
    It is not clear at this point if this is a bug with AdMob or Titanium.
    In any event, you will either need to NOT set your screen support -- or set android:anyDensity="true" and adjust your app layout accordingly

    ## Getting Started

    View the [Using Titanium Modules](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules) document 
    for instructions on getting started with using this module in your application.

    ## Android

    Please note that if your androidManifest has screen support set to: android:anyDensity="false", any banner ads will 
    display too small on high density devices.
    It is not clear at this point if this is a bug with AdMob or Titanium.
    In any event, you will either need to NOT set your screen support -- or set android:anyDensity="true" and adjust your app layout accordingly

    In order to use the module you would need to add the following tags in your tiapp.xml

      <android 
          xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
          <manifest>
            <application>
              <meta-data
                  android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
                  android:value="your-admob-application-id"/>
            </application>
          </manifest>
        </android>

    ### Requirements

    - [x] Titanium SDK 7.0.0+
    - [x] [Ti.PlayServices](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.playservices) module

    ## iOS

    The Google AdMob Ads SDK has the following requirements:
    
    * An AdMob site ID.
    * Xcode 6.4 or later.
    * Runtime of iOS 7.1 or later.
    * If using module 2.5.0+, add following key in tiapp.xml, inside ios plist section.   
        <key>GADIsAdManagerApp</key>
        <true/>
    * If using Xcode 12.0+, set minimum ios version 11.0+ using following key in tiapp.xml, inside ios section to run app on simulators.
      If app supports iOS < 11.0, be sure to remove it while building for device or app distribution. 
        <min-ios-ver>11.0<</min-ios-ver>

    Add the following key in tiapp.xml    
        <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
        <string>YOUR-APP-ID</string>
    
    Starting in iOS 14, IDFA will be unavailable until an app calls the App Tracking Transparency framework to present the app-tracking authorization request to the end user. 
    To display the App Tracking Transparency authorization request for accessing the IDFA, update your tiapp.xml to add the NSUserTrackingUsageDescription key with a custom message describing your usage.
    Below is an example description text:

      <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
      <string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>

    To present the authorization request, call requestTrackingAuthorization. We recommend waiting for the completion callback prior to loading ads, so that if the user grants the App Tracking Transparency permission, the Google AdMob SDK can use the IDFA in ad requests.
    For more information about the possible status values, see TRACKING_AUTHORIZATION_STATUS_*.
    If an app does not present this request, the IDFA will automatically be zeroed out which may lead to a significant loss in ad revenue.    

    The Google AdMob SDK supports conversion tracking using Apple's SKAdNetwork, which means Google is able to attribute an app install even when IDFA is unavailable.
    To enable this functionality, you will need to update the SKAdNetworkItems key with an additional dictionary in your tiapp.xml
    
    <key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
      <array>
        <dict>
          <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
          <string>cstr6suwn9.skadnetwork</string>
        </dict>
     </array>

    If you use Facebook Audience Network mediation, starting with iOS 14, you will need to implement the setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled flag.
    This allows you to inform Facebook whether to use the data to deliver personalized ads. If the flag is set to false, Facebook will not be able to deliver personalized ads.
    You need to set this flag before initializing the mediation SDK in order to receive it in the bidding request.

    If you use InMobi mediation, instead, you will have to use the method setInMobi_updateGDPRConsent to deliver personalized ads.

    A complete documentation is present in /ios module folder.

        It is a best practice to load a form every time the user launches your app, even if you determine consent is not required, so that the form is ready to display in case the user wishes to change their consent setting.
        The forms for obtaining consent are created in AdMob UI. Once you have determined that you will ask a user for consent, the next step is to determine if a form is available. There are a variety of reasons why a form may not be available, such as:
        1) The user has limit ad tracking enabled.
        2) You tagged the user as under the age of consent.
        To check if a form is available, use the callback status parameter
